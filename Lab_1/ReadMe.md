# Lab 1 Notes
## Make Note: cmake version
- cmake version 3.22.1
## Make Note: make targets
The generated Makefile seems to describe the targets
- all: compile and link all executables
- clean: remove executables generated through make
- depend: reevaluate dependencies
- edit_cache: modify CMakeCache.txt (?)
- rebuild_cache: reinitialize cache variables through regenerating build system (?)
- hello_world: generate the hello_world executable
- hello.o: compile hello source code into object file
- hello.i: preprocesses hello source code
- hello.s: generates assembly for hello source code
## Questions
- target_sources and target_include_directories are relative to the CMakeLists.txt
- cmake generates build systems such as make or ninja, while ninja is a build system
- Files generated by cmake should be kept apart from source code by using a separate directory
